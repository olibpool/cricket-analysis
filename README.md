My python scripts for producing graphs and stats for players' cricketing careers.


For this to work you will need to have python 3 installed on your computer and have installed both matplotlib and pandas.
If you have python 3 installed then it's easy to install these, you can just write 'pip install matplotlib' and 'pip install pandas' while running python in your command line.

This repo includes the test database, but unfortunately the ODI database is too large to fit on here, so you can instead download it from:
https://data.world/cclayford/cricinfo-statsguru-data/workspace/file?filename=Men+ODI+Player+Innings+Stats+-+21st+Century.csv

Just make sure that you open up the .csv in excel and sort it by innings date (earliest to latest) for the games to be analysed in the correct order.

WARNING:
These scripts will only work if the .csv files are in the same directory as the scripts and are not renamed to anything else.
